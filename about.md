## In short
10 years of technical writing experience and 3 years of copy editing experience.

Always editing, usually troubleshooting.

## The long version

As a technical writer, I have:
* Created and updated all types of documentation: user guides, admin guides, API guides, release notes.
* Coordinated documentation delivery on a monthly release cycle, within an Agile environment.
* Served as point of contact for other teams and raised the profile of the Documentation team in the company.
* Gave presentations to internal teams and to clients.
* Reviewed the work of junior writers.
* Provided technical support to a department of ~20 writers for RoboHelp, FrameMaker, SVN, JIRA, Word, HTML.
* Wrote basic VBA and Python scripts to automate tasks.
* Done lots and lots of training and mentoring for junior writers.
* Coordinated recruitment process, from resume selection through interviewing and offers.
* Helped with QA testing.

In my previous life as a copy editor, I ensured that books translated from English to Romanian met the quality standards of the publishing house.
