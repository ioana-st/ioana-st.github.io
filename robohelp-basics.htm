    <h1 class="pt-5">What is RoboHelp?</h1>
    <p>RoboHelp is a help authoring tool used to generate output in various formats from one source (this is called
      single sourcing).</p>
    <p>In this company we generate
      <strong>WebHelp</strong>,
      <strong>Responsive Help</strong>
      and
      <strong>Word</strong>
      (transformed to
      <strong>PDF</strong>
      for final delivery). This tutorial will refer primarily to WebHelp, as
      that
      is the main deliverable.</p>
    <h1 class="pt-5">Getting Started</h1>
    <p>To start working with RoboHelp, you need to either open an existing project or create a new one.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
      In this company, we work mostly with existing projects.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>You can open or create a project from the
    <strong>Starter</strong>
    screen or from the
    <strong>File</strong>
    menu.
  </p>

  <h2 class="pt-4">About RH Projects</h2>
  <p>A basic RoboHelp project - defined as a project that can be used to generate a delivery-ready output - should
    at
    least contain the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Topics - the HTML files drafted by the technical writers.</li>
    <li>Table of contents - a structure for these topics</li>
    <li>Single source layout (SSL) - the settings used to generate the output</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A basic workflow for generating a deliverable (output) is:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Draft the topics.
    </li>
    <li>Organize them into a table of contents.</li>
    <li>Define the output preferences in an SSL.</li>
    <li>Generate the output.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This output can then be published (copied) to a website, an internal shared drive, etc.</p>
  <h2 class="pt-4">About the Interface</h2>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/interface.png">
  <p>The image above explains the most commonly used components
  </p>
  <p>Other features that are commonly used are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conditional build tags - "labels" that can be applied to text or images and allow you to selectively
      output
      content based on an expression</li>
    <li>Variables - small fragments of text that can be defined once and reused throughout the project;
      variables
      can be part of a variable set.</li>
    <li>Snippets - larger fragments of text that can be defined once and reused throughout the project.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 class="pt-5">Topics</h1>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Creating a Topic</h2>
  <p>Topics are HTML pages that make up the online help system - topics are essentially our documentation. You can
    create topics starting from the
    <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    pod or the
    <strong>TOC</strong>
    - the
    differences are described in the table below.</p>
  <table class="table">
    <thead class="thead-light">
      <tr>
        <th colspan="1">Action</th>
        <th colspan="1">Screenshot</th>
        <th colspan="1">Result</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Right-click a folder in the
            <strong>Project Manager
            </strong>and select
            <strong>New &gt;
              Topic</strong>.</p>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">This is the recommended way.</div>
          </div>
          <p class="auto-cursor-target">
            <br />
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/new_proj_manager.png">
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>The topic is created in the folder you selected.</p>
          <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/new_proj_manager_created.png">
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Right-click a book in the
          <strong>TOC</strong>
          and select
          <strong>New &gt; Topic</strong>.</td>
        <td>
          <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/new_toc.png">
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>The topic is created in the root folder.</p>
          <p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/new_toc_created.png">
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p></p>When you create a new topic, you need to fill in the details in the
  <strong>New Topic</strong>
  window.
  You
  generally only need to write the
  <strong>Topic Title</strong>. This name will be automatically added as a
  Heading 1
  at the top of the topic, and it will also be displayed in the
  <strong>Project Manager</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>The
    <strong>File Name</strong>
    is the name under which the topic is saved to your HDD and it is created
    automatically from your topic title. These two names do not have to be identical, but it is good practice to
    use
    the same name in both fields.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    Do not use any special characters (&amp;, –, —, (, ) etc) in the
    <strong>File Name</strong>
    field. The
    <strong>Topic Title</strong>
    can use them, but make sure you replace them with
    <strong>_</strong>
    in the
    <strong>File Name</strong>
    if RoboHelp does not do it automatically.
  </div>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/new_topic.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Editing Topic Properties</h2>
  <p>After you have created a topic, you can change its properties by right-clicking it in the
    <strong>Project
      Manager</strong>. This opens a window identical to the
    <strong>New Topic</strong>
    window.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/topic_properties.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Deleting a Topic</h2>
  <p>To delete a topic, right-click it in the
    <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    and select
    <strong>Delete</strong>.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    Never delete a topic unless you are sure it is not referenced in
    other
    topics or the
    TOC!</div>
  <p>To check topic links, right-click the topic (in the
    <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    or
    <strong>TOC</strong>)
    and
    select
    <strong>Show &gt; Topic Links</strong>. This displays the topics that link to the current topic and
    the
    topics that the current topics links to.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/topic_links.png">
  <p>To check topic references, right-click the topic (in the
    <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    or
    <strong>TOC</strong>) and select
    <strong>Show &gt; Topic References</strong>. This displays all the above
    links,
    plus the references in the TOC or Index.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/topic_references.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Adding a Topic to the TOC</h2>
  <p>To add a topic to the table of contents, simply drag it from the
    <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    into the
    <strong>TOC</strong>
    pod.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/add_to_toc.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Adding Content to a Topic</h2>
  <p>You can edit topics in
    <strong>Design Mode</strong>
    or in
    <strong>HTML Mode</strong>.</p>
  <table class="table">
    <thead class="thead-light">
      <tr>
        <th colspan="1">Mode</th>
        <th colspan="1">Screenshot</th>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>Design Mode</strong>
          offers a WYSIWYG editor that uses common formatting shortcuts (CTRL
          +
          B, etc)</td>
        <td>
          <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/design_mode.png">
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>HTML Mode</strong>
          lets you edit the source of the file directly.</td>
        <td>
          <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/html_mode.png">
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Each topic has to be associated to a stylesheet that is defined at the project level. If your new topic
    does not pick up the correct stylesheet automatically, you can add it yourself from the
    <strong>Edit</strong>
    ribbon tab.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/add_stylesheet.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Formatting Content</h2>
  <p>Most formatting commands can be found on the
    <strong>Edit</strong>
    ribbon tab.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <strong>Never</strong>
    use inline formatting except for bold, italic, bullets and numbering. All other
    formatting needs to be applied using one of the styles that are predefined in the CSS.</p>
    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/predefined_styles.png"></br></br>
    <strong>Never</strong>
    paste content from Word or from other applications that include text formatting!
    If you need to paste text, pass it through Notepad or similar first. You can also download the free
    utility
    <a href="http://stevemiller.net/puretext/">PureText</a>.
  </div>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Dropdowns</h2>
  <p>Dropdowns are RoboHelp-specific elements that allow you to "hide" content until you click the dropdown.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/dropdown.png">
  <p>To insert a drop down, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Write the text that you will apply the dropdown effect to.</li>
    <li>Select the text.</li>
    <li>On the
      <strong>Insert</strong>
      tab, click
      <strong>DropDown text</strong>. The
      <strong>Dropdown text
        editor</strong>
      opens.</li>
    <li>Enter your text or image.</li>
    <li>Click outside the dropdown editor to close it and save the changes.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    RoboHelp also offers Expanding Text. The principle is the same, except that the image or text is
    displayed to the left of the "link", on the same line. We do not use these in our documentation.
  </div>
  </div>
  <h1 class="pt-5">Table of Contents</h1>
  <p>The table of contents defines the structure of the content (the way it is displayed in the online help
    output).
    The TOC is structured into books and pages. Each page is essentially a link to a topic that exists in the
    project.</p>
  <p>
    <ac:image ac:queryparams="effects=drop-shadow">
      <ri:attachment ri:filename="image2015-9-10 15:41:28.png" />
    </ac:image>
  </p>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Topic Properties</h2>
  <p>You can edit the properties of a topic (though you usually don't need to) by right-clicking it and selecting
    <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    <ac:image ac:queryparams="effects=drop-shadow">
      <ri:attachment ri:filename="image2015-9-10 15:34:13.png" />
    </ac:image>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The
      <strong>Page Title</strong>
      indicates the text that is displayed in the TOC of the generated online
      help.</li>
    <li>The
      <strong>Page Destination</strong>
      section allows you to change the destination of the page (but you
      generally shouldn't do this).</li>
    <li>The
      <strong>Link to</strong>
      field shows the location of the destination file on the disk.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Book Properties</h2>
  <p>The properties for a book are similar:</p>
  <p>
    <ac:image ac:queryparams="effects=drop-shadow">
      <ri:attachment ri:filename="2015-10-15_14-22-06.png" />
    </ac:image>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The
    <strong>Book with Link</strong>
    setting indicates what happens when you click a book in the generated
    output:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the book is not linked to a topic, clicking it simply expands the next level. This is the recommended
      setting.</li>
    <li>If the book is linked to a topic, clicking it opens that topic and also expands the next level.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Single source layouts allow you to generate various types of output starting from a single source. In this
    company, we mostly use
    <strong>WebHelp</strong>,
    <strong>Printed Documentation</strong>
    and
    <strong>Responsive
      Help</strong>.</p>
  <h1 class="pt-5">Layouts</h1>
  <p>SSLs are managed in the
    <strong>Outputs (SSL)</strong>
    pod.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/ssl.png">
  <p>You can rename your outputs or keep the default names (but this is usually standardized at the product team
    level, so don't go changing things without asking first).</p>
  <p>The buttons at the top of the pod let you perform various actions like creating a new layout or duplicating
    an
    existing one.</p>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Generating Output</h2>
  <p>To generate an output, simply double-click the respective layout and follow the steps of the wizard.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    The settings are usually standardized at the product team level and should be already saved in the SSL.
  </div>
  </div>
  <h1 class="pt-5">Conditional Build Tags</h1>
  <p>Conditional build tags (CBT) are RoboHelp-specific code snippets that allow you to customize one set of
    source
    files for multiple audiences or purposes. For example, if you are writing a new topic, but you haven't
    finished
    yet, you can use a conditional build tag to make sure that the incomplete content is not published by
    mistake.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can apply CBT to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Text</li>
    <li>Topics in the
      <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Pages in the TOC</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <span>If you want to hide a topic from the output, you need to apply the conditional build tag in the
      <strong>Project Manager</strong>. When you do this, the topic is also hidden from the TOC when the
      module is generated (but it's still a good idea to also apply the tag to the corresponding TOC page,
      to
      make it obvious that the topic is hidden).</span></br></br>
    <span>If you apply a tag to the TOC page
      <em>only</em>, the topic is still generated and can be found via
      search (and we don't want that).</span>
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    You can
    <strong>not</strong>
    apply CBT to baggage files.
  </div>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Applying Conditional Build Tags</h2>
  <p>To apply a tag to an element, simply select it, right-click, select
    <strong>Apply Conditional Build
      Tag</strong>,
    then choose an existing tag or create a new one.</p>
  <p>You can also drag the tags from the
    <strong>Conditional Build Tags</strong>
    pod to the selected text or to a
    topic/page.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/apply_cbt.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Previewing Conditionalized Text</h2>
  <p>If you want to see what your output would look like if you excluded a specific conditional build tag, you can
    preview the topic by clicking
    <strong>View Item</strong>
    on the
    <strong>Project</strong>
    ribbon tab and then
    changing the
    <strong>Conditional Build Tag Expression</strong>.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/view_cbt.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Conditional Expressions</h2>
  <p>When generating an output for a RoboHelp project, conditional build tags are grouped into expressions to
    indicate
    what parts of the content should be published.</p>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Removing Conditional Build Tags</h2>
  <p>To remove a conditional build tag from an element, select the element, right-click it, select
    <strong>Apply
      Conditional Build Tag</strong>, then click the applied conditional build tag to remove it.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/remove_cbt.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Managing Conditional Build Tags</h2>
  <p>CBT are managed in the
    <strong>Conditional Build Tags</strong>
    pod.</p>
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/cbt_pod.png">
  <p>In this pod, you can create and delete tags, and view tag properties. All these options are available in the
    context menu.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    If you delete a conditional build tag, it is removed from all the places it had been applied, therefore
    you must be careful -
    <strong>never</strong>
    delete a tag before checking if it is in use! To do this,
    right-click the tag and select
    <strong>Properties</strong>.</br>

</ac:structured-macro>
<h2 class="pt-4">Example - Printed Documentation</h2><img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/online_cbt.png">
<p>In this topic, we have tagged the links in the topic with the <strong>Online</strong> CBT. This way, we can
  leave
  the links visible in the WebHelp output, but we can hide them from the PDF output.</p>
<h1 class="pt-5">Variables</h1>
<p>In RoboHelp, variables are small bits of text that are defined once and can be reused throughout the module.
  You
  can define simple variables or variable sets. Variable sets are collections of variables that have a
  different
  value for each variable set.</p>
<p>Variable example: product name. If you inserted the product name as a variable and the product name changes,
  you
  only need to update the variable and the product name is changed everywhere.</p>
<p>Variable set example: product versions. Our two applications have different versioning, but the help is
  generated from the same source. We use two variable sets: one for the first application (versioning: 4.3.2,
  4.3.3, 5.1.2) and one for second one (6.3.2, 6.3.3, 7.1.2). By choosing the appropriate variable set in the
  SSL,
  the versions in the outputs are different between the two.</p>
<h2 class="pt-4">Defining Variables</h2>
<p>Variables and variable sets are defined in the <strong>User Defined Variables</strong> pod.</p>
<h2 class="pt-4">Creating a Variable</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In the
    <strong>User Defined Variables</strong>
    pod, click
    <strong>Create a New User Defined
      Variable</strong>. The
    <strong>New Variable</strong>
    window is displayed.</li>
  <li>Enter a
    <strong>Variable Name</strong>. This is used for identification purposes and is not displayed in
    the
    output, for example, Product_Name.</li>
  <li>Enter a
    <strong>Variable Value</strong>. This is the text that is displayed in the output, for example,
    KaTet.</li>
  <li>Click
    <strong>OK</strong>. The new variable is displayed in the pod.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="pt-4">Creating a Variable Set</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In the
    <strong>User Defined Variables</strong>
    pod, click
    <strong>Add/Edit/Delete Variable Set</strong>.
    The
    <strong>Variable Set
    </strong>window is displayed.</li>
  <li>Click
    <strong>Add</strong>. A new row is added.</li>
  <li>Enter a name for the set and click
    <strong>OK</strong>. You cannot edit or delete the
    <strong>Default
      Variable Set</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="pt-4">Defining Variable Values in Sets</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Define a variable in the usual way.</li>
  <li>Double-click the variable. The
    <strong>User Defined Variable Properties</strong>
    window is displayed.
    The
    variable value you entered is assigned by default to all variable sets.</li>
  <li>Under
    <strong>Variable Set</strong>, choose a set and change the value of the variable accordingly.
    Repeat
    until the variable is defined correctly for all sets.</li>
  <li>Click
    <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="pt-4">Inserting Variables</h2>
<p>Variables can be used in topic content, topic titles, and the TOC.</p>
<h2 class="pt-4">Variables in Topic Content</span></h2>
<p>To insert a variable in a topic, drag the variable from the <strong>User Defined
    Variables</strong> pod to the desired place in the topic.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">If you are using variable sets, the values for the <strong>Default
    Variable Set</strong> are displayed in the topics.</div>
</div>
<h2 class="pt-4">Variables in Titles</h2>
<p>To insert a variable in a topic title
  or TOC entry:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the topic, TOC
    book or TOC page and select <strong>Properties</strong>. The <strong>Properties</strong> window for the
    respective
    type of element is displayed.</li>
  <li>Position the cursor at the
    point where you want to add the variable.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Variables</strong> drop-down, select the required variable.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Insert</strong>. The variable is added.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="pt-4">Generating Output with Variables</h2>
<p>If you are not using variable sets, you do not need to do anything extra in the SSL.</p>
<p>If you are using variable sets, make sure you select the correct one in the SSL.</p>
<h2 class="pt-4">Deleting Variables</h2>
<p>To delete a variable, select it in the <strong>User Defined Variables</strong> pod and click <strong>Delete</strong>.
  The following options are displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delete variable and its reference</strong> - completely removes the variable from the module.
    For
    example, if you had a variable called<em>KaTet</em>and a line that said<em>
      "&lt;KaTet&gt; is a
      Deschain
      product"</em>, choosing this option would leave<em>" is a Deschain product"</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete only the variable</strong> - deletes the variable from the pod, but leaves references to
    the variable in the HTML of the respective topics. In the above example, the text would become<em>ERROR:
      Variable (KaTet) is undefined is a Deschain product.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Delete variable and replace with actual content</strong> - deletes the variable, but replaces it
    with the variable value (static text) in the topics.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">In general, you not should delete variables unless you are sure that they
  are not used anywhere.
  To check if a variable is used or not, look at the <strong>Used in Topics</strong> section in its
  <strong>Properties</strong> window.</div>
<h1 class="pt-5">Single Projects</h2>
  <p>To create a new RoboHelp project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open RoboHelp 2015 and click <strong>Blank Project</strong>.<br /><img class="img-thumbnail"
        src="assets/images/blank_project.png"></li>
    <li>On the <strong>New Project Wizard</strong> window, enter the title, file name and location of the
      new
      project to be created.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
    <li>Copy the CSS file from one of the existing RH projects.</li>
    <li>Open the folder where you created the new RH project and paste the CSS file.</li>
    <li>Press CTRL+S to save all the changes. You can now delete the <strong>First
        Topic</strong> page and create the pages you need in the <strong>Project Manager</strong> pane.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1 class="pt-5">Merged Projects</h1>
  <p>In this company, the most common use of the merged projects functionality is the so-called "master
    project"
    of
    the online help system. The main advantage is that, instead of having one large RoboHelp project for the
    entire
    help (which would be unwieldy and would probably crash RoboHelp), we can split the documentation by
    module
    and
    simply assemble the modules into one TOC using the master.</p>
  <p>Merged projects are added and organized using the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> pod, just like any
    topic.
    You can use merged projects, books and topics together in the same TOC. You can also use merged projects
    inside
    other merged projects.</p>
  <p>The screenshot below is an example of a master project that contains 4 topics and several merged
    projects.</p><img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/images/master.png">
  <h2 class="pt-4">Creating Merged Projects</h2>
  <p>To add a new merged project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> pod, click <strong>New Merged Project</strong>. The <strong>Merged
        Project</strong> window is displayed.</li>
    <li>On the <strong>FlashHelp/WebHelp/Multiscreen/Adobe AIR</strong> tab, type the name of the project
      you
      want to link (the name of the .xpj of that project). You can also browse for the location of the
      .xpj,
      but
      it is not required.</li>
    <li>
      <p>Click
        <strong>OK</strong>. The merged project is added in the TOC with a specific icon.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="pt-4">Merged Projects Structure</h2>
  <p>If you have a project defined with merged projects, the following structure is generated when you build
    WebHelp:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>all the usual files in the project</li>
    <li>a <strong>mergedProjects</strong> folder in the root of the project.</li>
    <li>inside the <strong>mergedProjects</strong> folder, a sub-folder for each merged (child) project,
      with
      the
      name defined in the TOC</li>
    <li>inside each sub-folder, two files:<ul>
        <li>MasterData_xml.js</li>
        <li>readme.txt</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
        If you use the
        <strong>Show Merged TOC in Child Project</strong>
        option in the
        WebHelp SSL, you should not delete these files, as the
        <strong>Show</strong>
        link won't work
        correctly anymore.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
