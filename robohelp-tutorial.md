**Description**: Introduction to RoboHelp 2015, a tutorial for new technical writers joining the team, highlighting the main features they would use on the job.

**Audience**: Junior technical writers with no prior knowledge of RoboHelp.

**Tool**: HTML with Bootstrap 4 (initially in Confluence). 

<small>You can view the [GitHub history](https://github.com/ioana-st/ioana-st.github.io/compare/8f125ef..911adf4) of the page to see how I converted the tutorial from Confluence XHTML to plain HTML styled with Bootstrap.</small>
