Most of the documentation I've written is not public and cannot be shared due to IP, but here is some internal or non-work-related documentation I _can_ share:
* Internal documentation for using Postman to run a report using one of the company's API - [Making calls with Postman](postman)
* Documentation for updating a Wordpress blog based on a theme with custom features - [Wordpress documentation for Ovation theme](wordpress-doc)
* Presentation to the students at the Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literatures - [Technical writing 101](technical-writing-101)
* Introduction to HTML & CSS - [HTML & CSS basics](html-css)
